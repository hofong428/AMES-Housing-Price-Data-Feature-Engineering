# Housing_Princing_Feature-_Engineering
Using Ames Housing price monthly data to process feature engineering, the feature engineering incudes the following steps:  
- Dealing with Outliers  
- Dealing with Missing Value  
- Dealing with Dates and Time  
- Dealing with Various Data Types  
- Feature Scaling  
- Feature/Variable Tranformation  
- Feature Encoding  
And the measuring associations between features and target with function utility metric is critical. Mutual information method is a general-pupose matrix we take here. It describes relathionships in terms of uncertainty. I exploit it to know the relative potential of a feature as a predictor of the target.
